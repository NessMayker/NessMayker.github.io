I started taking the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">"Practical Deep Learning for Coders"</a> course from fast.ai.

The first two lessons introduce a simple image classifier that checks if an image is a cat or a dog. Followng the tutorial, I reproduce the classifier and make an interactive predicter using a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/NessMaykerChen/CatVsDogClassifier">huggingface space</a> and <a href="https://www.gradio.app/">gradio</a>.

The classifier performs well when the images are cats or dogs, but has not been trained to classify other images, so it basically tries to measure how dog like or cat like the rest of the examples are and returns some humourous results.

I'm looking forward to building more sophisticated image classifiers in the future!
