I am a PhD candidate at the Ohio State University. My research focus is on supernova environments. These environments can tell us both about where supernovae come from and the influence they have on their surroundings. I love writing code and making plots. I am planning to graduate in Spring 2024 and transition out of academia and into industry. I have been studying data science and deep learning to better prepare myself for the transition.

I started this website as a place to store and share my projects as I learn. I quickly realized that much of the coding I am doing isn’t really suited for this purpose, but I still wanted to make a record of it and share it. The only way I could think of doing this is to make posts that read like something between a tutorial and a performance report.

I am learning data science and deep learning in a somewhat individual and unguided way. By writing about what I am learning, I am able to more fully understand the material. I am by no means an expert (in fact quite the opposite) and although I have been careful, I may misrepresent something due to my own misunderstanding. 

My goal is to capture what it is like to be learning data science in an honest and unflashy way. I want to ponder why my models aren’t working out loud as well as share my coding successes in a hope to maybe inspire other budding data scientists or give my friends an understanding of what I do in my free time.

With all that being said, I’m not really sure who my intended audience is for this website, but if you made it here I hope that you find it interesting.
